DESCRIPTION

ReportGenerator converts coverage reports generated by OpenCover, dotCover, Visual Studio, NCover, Cobertura, JaCoCo or 
Clover into human readable reports in various formats.

The reports do not only show the coverage quota, but also include the source code and visualize which lines have been
covered.

ReportGenerator supports merging several reports into one.

The following output formats are supported by ReportGenerator:

-Html, HtmlSummary, HtmlInline, HtmlInline_AzurePipelines, HtmlInline_AzurePipelines_Dark, HtmlChart, MHtml
-Cobertura
-SonarQube
-lcov
-Xml, XmlSummary
-JsonSummary
-Latex, LatexSummary
-TeamCitySummary
-TextSummary
-CsvSummary
-PngChart
-Badges
-Custom formats (https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator/wiki/Custom-reports)

Compatibility:

OpenCover, coverlet, altcover
dotCover
Visual Studio (vstest.console.exe, CodeCoverage.exe)
NCover (tested version 1.5.8, other versions may not work)
